Given a number, change all bits at even positions to 0.

Example:

Input : 30
Output : 10
Binary representation of 11110. 
Bits at Even positions are highlighted. 
After making all of them 0, we get 01010
Input:
First line consists of T test cases. Only line, consists of a integer N.

Output:
Single line output, print the modified number.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
1<=N<=(32-bit number)

Example:
Input:
2
30
10
Output:
10
