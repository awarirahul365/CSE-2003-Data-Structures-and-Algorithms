Damon wants to become a mathematician . He tries different combination of numbers and keeps playing with them . Once he found a different kind of numbers and named them as Damon Prime . For example :  4 is a damon prime , 6 is a damon prime , 102 is a damon prime , etc .
Now Damon wants to test you , he will give you an integer " N " , you need to find whether the number is Damon Prime or not . 

Input:
    First line of input contains no. of testcases .
    Second line contains the integer " N "  for which you have to check whether it is damon prime or not . 
 

Output:
     Output for each test case is of one line with output as " Y "  when the input integer is damon prime else  " N " . 
 

Constraints: 
 1 < = T < = 10^4
1 < = N < = 10^4
