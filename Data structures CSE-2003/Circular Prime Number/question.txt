A prime number is a Circular Prime Number if all of its possible rotations are itself prime numbers. Now given a number N check if it is Circular Prime or Not.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case contains an integer N.

Output:
For each test case in a new line print 1 if the number is circular prime else 0.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 100
1 <= N <= 104

Example:
Input:
2
197
101
Output:
1
0

Explanation:
For first test case:
197 is a Circular Prime because all rotations of 197 are
197, 719, 971 all of the 3 are prime number's
hence 197 is a circular prime

For second test case:
101 isn't a prime number as
rotation of 101 yields 110 which isn't a prime number
hence 101 isn't circular prime
