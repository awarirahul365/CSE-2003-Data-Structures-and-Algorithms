Given a number N, you need to write a program that finds the sum of digits of the number till the number becomes a single digit and then check whether the number is Prime/Non-Prime.
Example:

Input : 5602
Output: No
Step 1- 5+6+0+2 = 13
Step 2- 1+3 = 4 
4 is not prime

Input : 56
Output : Yes
Step 1- 5+6 = 11
Step 2- 1+1 = 2 hence 2 is prime 
Input:
First line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test case follows. The only lone of each testcase contains the integer N.

Output:
For each test case print "P" if the resultant is prime and "NP" if the number is Non-prime.

Constraints:
1<=T<=103
1<=N<=105

Example:
Input:
2
1903
25
Output:
NP
P
