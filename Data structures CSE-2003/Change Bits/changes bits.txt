Given a number you are required to complete two tasks 
Task 1 .Generate a new number form the old number by changing  the number of zeroes in the binary representation of that  number to 1
Task  2. Find what will be added to old number to generate the new number .

Input:
The first line consists of T test cases. Then T test cases follow. The next T lines will consist of a number N.

Output:
Output the difference between those 2 numbers separated by the new number.

Constraints:
1<=T<=10000
1<=N<=100000

Example:
Input:
2
8
6
Output:
7 15
1 7
Explanation:
For first test case there are 3 zeroes in binary representation of 8 . Changing them to 1 will give 15. Difference between two is 7.
