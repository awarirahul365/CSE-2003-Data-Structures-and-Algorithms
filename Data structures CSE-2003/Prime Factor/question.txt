Given a number N. The task is to print all its unique prime factors in increasing order.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. T testcases follow.
The first line of each test case is N.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, print all prime factors in increasing order separated by space.

Constraints:
1 = T = 10000
2 = N = 106

Example:
Input:
2
100
35
Output:
2 5
5 7

Explanation:
Testcase1: 2 and 5 are the only prime factors of 100.
